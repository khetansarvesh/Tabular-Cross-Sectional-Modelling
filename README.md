Broadly following are different types of Machine Learning algorithms or learning algorithms:
- [Supervised Learning / Forecasting](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/Tabular-Cross-Sectional-Modelling/blob/main/modelling/supervised_learning.md)
- [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/Tabular-Cross-Sectional-Modelling/blob/main/modelling/unsupervised_learning.md)
- [Semi Supervised Learning](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/Tabular-Cross-Sectional-Modelling/blob/main/modelling/semi_supervised_learning.md) : This algorithm is used when your table contains some data without the dependent variable (Y) and some data with the dependent variable (Y) along with the independent variables (X1,X2,X3……).Hence a combo of both supervised and unsupervised kind of data. Usually data without dependent variable (Y) is more compared with dependent variable (Y). It involves techniques like
1. Active Learning (most used)
2. Transductive Learning 
3. Co-training 
4. Self training
  
It is useful when extracting relevant features from complex and high volume data, i.e., medical images. 

- [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/Tabular-Cross-Sectional-Modelling/blob/main/modelling/reinforcement_learning.md) (RL)

Analogy of training a dog : 
1. if a dog does a good job we pat him and tell him to be a good boy and sometimes reward him with food 
2. if he does some bad task then we say him bad boy and punish him. 
3. Over time the dog gets trained and understands what is a good task and what is a bad task.

Similarly we need to do this with machines wherein the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error. This machine learns from past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate business decisions. Desired outcomes provide AI with reward while undesired outcomes result in punishments (Z function).

Hence here the task is to learn both Y (actions) and F (policy) using X (states) and Z (reward functions). Examples of this can be 
1. how you learn to drive a bicycle or learn to walk via trial and error
2. how to train a helicopter to automatically fly?
