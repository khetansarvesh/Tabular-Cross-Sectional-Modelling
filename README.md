Broadly following are different types of Machine Learning algorithms or learning algorithms:

### 1. Supervised Learning / Forecasting 
This algorithm is used when your table contains dependent variable (Y) (also called target variable or labeled variable) which is to be predicted and independent variables (X1,X2,X3……). And your task is the learn the function F which forms the mapping between X and Y
- Regression
- Classification
