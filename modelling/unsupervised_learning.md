# Unsupervised Learning (UL)

This algorithm is used when your table contains only  independent variables (X1,X2,X3……) and no dependent variable (Y). Here also the task is to learn the function F which shows relation between X1, X2, X3,....

Algorithms discussed here are used mainly for data mining purposes i.e. to explore/analyze the data already present with us and not exactly for predictive analysis i.e. predicting results. People just have put this under ML umbrella but its main use is in data mining. It includes

- You can use overcomplete autoencoders for this task Sparse Autoencoders / Denoising Autoencoders
- In Fact you can use any deep learning generative model

### <ins> 3. Denoising Data </ins>
Suppose you want to remove noise from your data then how can you do??? Use under complete autoencoders
But first you will have to create noisy data to train your autoencoder on that. You can create noisy data by adding some gaussian noise on the original data
