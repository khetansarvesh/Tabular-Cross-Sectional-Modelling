Is also called Decision Tree Regressor or Regression Tree\n","2.   This is a non-linear regression algorithm\n","3.   It can be used for both 1 independent feature and more than 1 independent feature\n","4.   Decision tree has low bias and high variance as stated in the video but it is converted into low bias and low variance using pruning technique as shown in the video.This is taken care by the algorithm itself.This pruning thing is also called hyper parameter tuning of decision tree\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vN_tIb9BTMOY","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
