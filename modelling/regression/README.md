# Regression - From Scratch
Here I have implemented algorithms from scratch to solve the regression problem.Following are the algorithms that I have implemented
## 1. Multiple Linear Regression
This project teaches us how actually the multiple linear regression algorithm is used to solve the regression problem and how it is written in the sklearn library and the indepth mathematical intuition behind this
algorithm because I have implemented this algorithm from scratch.

The entire theory for the implementation can be understood by referring to my notes at following link (recommended as must read) : [theory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13xf3lC5jQ4xxpq8J64SIyb0VDJaXeQUI?usp=sharing)

The dataset used can be found at this link : [dataset](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/Tabular-Cross-Sectional-Modelling/blob/main/dataset/insurance.txt)

By reading the theory you might have understood that ultimately the algorithm reduces to solving an unconstrained nonlinear optimization problem and we know there are several ways to solve this optimization problem so here we will be solve this optimization problem via these methods from scratch:
1. Normal Equations
2. Gradient Descent
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent

You can find the code for all of these at following link :

Please refer to the report to understand code design and result analysis : [report](https://github.com/khetansarvesh/Tabular-Cross-Sectional-Modelling/blob/main/modelling/regression/Multiple-Linear-Regression/Report.pdf)

## 2. Multiple Polynomial Regression

**Here I have implemented 'lasso regression' and 'ridge regression' to curb overfitting**
