# Semi Supervised Learning
This algorithm is used when your table contains some data without the dependent variable (Y) and some data with the dependent variable (Y) along with the independent variables (X1,X2,X3……).Hence a combo of both supervised and unsupervised kind of data. Usually data without dependent variable (Y) is more compared with dependent variable (Y). It involves techniques like
- Active Learning (most used)
- Transductive Learning 
- Co-training 
- Self training
  
It is useful when extracting relevant features from complex and high volume data, i.e., medical images.
