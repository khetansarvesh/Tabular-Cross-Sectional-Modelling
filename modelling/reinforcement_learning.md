# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Analogy of training a dog : 
- if a dog does a good job we pat him and tell him to be a good boy and sometimes reward him with food 
- if he does some bad task then we say him bad boy and punish him. 
- Over time the dog gets trained and understands what is a good task and what is a bad task.

Similarly we need to do this with machines wherein the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error. This machine learns from past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate business decisions. Desired outcomes provide AI with reward while undesired outcomes result in punishments (Z function).

Hence here the task is to learn both Y (actions) and F (policy) using X (states) and Z (reward functions). Examples of this can be 
- how you learn to drive a bicycle or learn to walk via trial and error
- how to train a helicopter to automatically fly?
