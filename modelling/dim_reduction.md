# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

There are many techniques to perform dimensionality reduction : 
1. Lossy Techniques : Techniques in which the reduced dataset shows somewhat less information compared to the original data fall under lossy techniques.
2. Lossless Techniques : Techniques in which the reduced dataset shows exactly the same information as the original data fall under lossless techniques.

Below we will understand many algorithms which can perform Lossy Dimensionality Reduction !! These lossy techniques can be further divided into two broad categories namely : 

## Linear Lossy Techniques
1. [Matrix Decomposition / Matrix Factorization / Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://pub.towardsai.net/principle-component-analysis-pca-mathematics-9cfba3c66b45) : In the blog I have only shown PCA using EVD and SVD but we can also use CUR decomposition. You can learn more about CUR decompotion is following videos -- [CUR1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO1KTzuKTSI) || [CUR2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgK_D6IyDbM) || [CUR3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgsuly5nxIw)
2. Metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) / Classical MDS / Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)
3. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
4. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) 
5. Fourier transformation / Discrete Wavelength Transformation (DWT)

## Non Linear Lossy Techniques (Manifold Learning)
