We have multiple learning algorithms/models to solve regression problems. There are 1000s of algorithms developed over the years with a different idea from different people and more such algorithms will continue to come up in the upcoming years but we study only some of the most useful and historically proven most efficient algorithms and these are listed below

- [Linear Regression](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/unfolding-maths-for-linear-regression-part-1-simple-linear-regression-561d9e6182f0) (Linear Model) (parametric model cause the no of parameters that needs to be determined is finite, here the parameters are weights)
- NonLinear Regression (Non Linear Model) (parametric model)
